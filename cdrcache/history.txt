  HIGHLIGHTS out of the history of LBAcache so far:

  12.-13.10.2001 first working version (fixed 1024 sec buffer).
      14.10.2001 added more verbosity, ... round-robin search. 860 lines ASM.
  18.-20.11.2001 wrote a LBA (and CHS) big version (needs more DOS RAM).
      23.11.2001 LBA version now does CHS and LBA, no CHS version anymore.

      22.01.2002 multi sector read collection in read.asm, various patches...
      10.11.2002 bigger element size (uses less DOS RAM), max 8 harddisks...
  13.-15.11.2002 Made LBAcache fast again with memoization in binsel2,
                 up to 25MB XMS... fixed unloading, improved messages a lot.

  ...-23.04.2003 floppy: all sizes <= 1.44 MB should work now, bugs fixed.
      26.06.2003 made TICKLE part of the package. (floppy read-ahead tool)
      27.08.2003 ... Added LBA harddisk support to TICKLE (experimental).

  *** 7 October 2003: Started CDRcache CD-ROM cache based on LBAcache. ***

  07.-08.10.2003 Initial CDRcache release, many debugging messages enabled.
      09.10.2003 Improved some messages and the user interface.
      12.10.2003 Fixed a command line parsing bug (device path was req'd).
  13.-14.10.2003 Added several/fixed options of the user interface: sleep,
                 wake up, verbosity level, clear statistics, help message.

      07.04.2004 Moved "flushed because of unknown disk change state" up to
                 "show in verbose mode only". Improved the error message of
                 "not cached because raw / redbook / invalid access".
      13.05.2004 Added an user friendly "short statistics" display and  the
                 ability to parse the "size" command line argument as a kBy
                 value (code taken from the newest LBAcache version).
